# Redmine Time Tracker plugin

Time tracker is a Redmine plugin to ease time tracking when working on an issue.
The plugin allows to start/stop a timer on a per user basis. The timer can be started with or without any reference to a Redmine Issue.

the issue list to start or stop the timer.

## What's what?

The Plugin is intended to help us create invoices for customers. This requires the separation of time that was spent and time that is booked. Only booked times can be billed.

###Time Tracker

The stop watch. Time you spent get's "generated" by the tracker 

###Time Log

A time log is a spent amount of time. If you stop the tracker, a time log is created. A time log has nothing attached to it. To add this time to issues or projects, you **book** time.
If you enable Redmine's own time management you are able to access these logs. Be aware that you should not edit time logs outside the interface provided by the plugin. Role permissions can be edited to disable logging. This might be useful for reviewers, that do not generate time own their own but want to look up statistics on a project or user.

###Time Booking

A booking is time that is actually connected to a task (project or issue). To create a booking, you book time from a time log. You are not limited to spent the whole time of a single booking, you can divide as you wish. You however aren't able book more time than what was actually logged. The role you have on projects and their settings determine if you are able to edit bookings or are just allowed to create them.

###Settings

The plugin offers a list of settings at the Redmine roles and permission settings page. Also you can set the size and file for a logo to be displayed at the report in the Redmine plugin settings.

###Report

Reports are the method of generating invoices for customers. The layout is set up to be a simple list and you are able to generate a print-out. You can add you custom logo via the plugin settings in the Redmine administration.
